            Hi there! Iâ€™m <strong>Bharat Deshmukh</strong>, a student of{" "}
            <strong>Lovely Professional University</strong>, and Iâ€™m excited to introduce you to{" "}
            <strong>Uni-Match</strong> a dating web app made exclusively for our LPU community. ðŸŽ‰

            Being a student myself, Iâ€™ve always felt thereâ€™s something special about the connections we build during our college years. Thatâ€™s what inspired me to create this web app a platform where you can meet, connect, and build meaningful relationships with fellow students, all within the comfort of our campus community.

            Why I Built This App

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            College life can get busy, and meeting new people outside of our usual friend circles isnâ€™t always easy. I wanted to solve that by creating a space where everyone feels welcome to make new connections, whether youâ€™re looking for love, friendship, or just someone to hang out with.
